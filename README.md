Honk! I’m [u/AnAbsurdlyAngryGoose](https://reddit.com/u/anabsurdlyangrygoose) and I build apps for the [Reddit Developer Platform](https://developers.reddit.com) — lovingly known as Devvit.

All the code you’ll find here is certified honkin’ fresh, hatched by my own feathers and entirely AI-free. My goal is to build tools that help online communities stay transparent, accountable, safe, and fun — and I take that responsibility seriously, even if I don’t take myself too seriously.
