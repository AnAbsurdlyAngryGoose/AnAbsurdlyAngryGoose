Honk! I’m [u/AnAbsurdlyAngryGoose](https://reddit.com/u/anabsurdlyangrygoose). I architect software for a living and help moderate online communities for fun. Somewhere in the overlap of those two worlds, I build tools that make communities clearer, safer, more accountable, and more enjoyable to be part of.

Some of these projects are open-source (or source-available). Feel free to poke around!
